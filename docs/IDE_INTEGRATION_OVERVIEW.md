# üöÄ Claude Code IDE Integration for Neovim

## üìã Overview

This document outlines the architectural design and implementation strategy for bringing true IDE integration capabilities to claude-code.nvim, transitioning from CLI-based communication to a robust Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration.

## üéØ Project Goals

Transform the current CLI-based Claude Code plugin into a full-featured IDE integration that matches the capabilities offered in VSCode and IntelliJ, providing:

- Real-time, bidirectional communication
- Deep editor integration with buffer manipulation
- Context-aware code assistance
- Performance-optimized synchronization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components

### 1. üîå MCP Server Connection Layer

The foundation of the integration, replacing CLI communication with direct server connectivity.

#### Key Features

- **Direct MCP Protocol Implementation**: Native Lua client for MCP server communication
- **Session Management**: Handle authentication, connection lifecycle, and session persistence
- **Message Routing**: Efficient bidirectional message passing between Neovim and Claude Code
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and connection recovery

#### Technical Requirements

- WebSocket or HTTP/2 client implementation in Lua
- JSON-RPC message formatting and parsing
- Connection pooling for multi-instance support
- Async/await pattern implementation for non-blocking operations

### 2. üîÑ Enhanced Context Synchronization

Intelligent context management that provides Claude with comprehensive project understanding.

#### Context Types

- **Buffer Context**: Real-time buffer content, cursor positions, and selections
- **Project Context**: File tree structure, dependencies, and configuration
- **Git Context**: Branch information, uncommitted changes, and history
- **Runtime Context**: Language servers data, diagnostics, and compilation state

#### Optimization Strategies

- **Incremental Updates**: Send only deltas instead of full content
- **Smart Pruning**: Context relevance scoring and automatic cleanup
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand context expansion based on Claude's needs
- **Caching Layer**: Reduce redundant context calculations

### 3. ‚úèÔ∏è Bidirectional Editor Integration

Enable Claude to directly interact with the editor environment.

#### Core Capabilities

- **Direct Buffer Manipulation**:
  - Insert, delete, and replace text operations
  - Multi-cursor support
  - Snippet expansion

- **Diff Preview System**:
  - Visual diff display before applying changes
  - Accept/reject individual hunks
  - Side-by-side comparison view

- **Refactoring Operations**:
  - Rename symbols across project
  - Extract functions/variables
  - Move code between files

- **File System Operations**:
  - Create/delete/rename files
  - Directory structure modifications
  - Template-based file generation

### 4. üé® Advanced Workflow Features

User-facing features that leverage the deep integration.

#### Interactive Features

- **Inline Suggestions**:
  - Ghost text for code completions
  - Multi-line suggestions with tab acceptance
  - Context-aware parameter hints

- **Code Actions Integration**:
  - Quick fixes for diagnostics
  - Automated imports
  - Code generation commands

- **Chat Interface**:
  - Floating window for conversations
  - Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
  - Code block execution

- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Gutter icons for Claude suggestions
  - Highlight regions being analyzed
  - Progress indicators for long operations

### 5. ‚ö° Performance & Reliability

Ensuring smooth, responsive operation without impacting editor performance.

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Asynchronous Architecture**: All operations run in background threads
- **Debouncing**: Intelligent rate limiting for context updates
- **Batch Processing**: Group related operations for efficiency
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of stale contexts

#### Reliability Features

- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to CLI mode when MCP unavailable
- **State Persistence**: Save and restore sessions across restarts
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits from user and Claude
- **Audit Trail**: Log all Claude operations for debugging

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

- Implement basic MCP client
- Establish connection protocols
- Create message routing system

### Phase 2: Context System (Weeks 3-4)

- Build context extraction layer
- Implement incremental sync
- Add project-wide awareness

### Phase 3: Editor Integration (Weeks 5-6)

- Enable buffer manipulation
- Create diff preview system
- Add undo/redo support

### Phase 4: User Features (Weeks 7-8)

- Develop chat interface
- Implement inline suggestions
- Add visual indicators

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (Weeks 9-10)

- Performance tuning
- Error handling improvements
- Documentation and testing

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Core Language**: Lua (Neovim native)
- **Async Runtime**: Neovim's event loop with libuv
- **UI Framework**: Neovim's floating windows and virtual text
- **Protocol**: MCP over WebSocket/HTTP
- **Testing**: Plenary.nvim test framework

## üöß Challenges & Mitigations

### Technical Challenges

1. **MCP Protocol Documentation**: Limited public docs
   - *Mitigation*: Reverse engineer from VSCode extension

2. **Lua Limitations**: No native WebSocket support
   - *Mitigation*: Use luv bindings or external process

3. **Performance Impact**: Real-time sync overhead
   - *Mitigation*: Aggressive optimization and debouncing

### Security Considerations

- Sandbox Claude's file system access
- Validate all buffer modifications
- Implement permission system for destructive operations

## üìà Success Metrics

- Response time < 100ms for context updates
- Zero editor blocking operations
- Feature parity with VSCode extension
- User satisfaction through community feedback

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Research MCP protocol specifics from available documentation
2. Prototype basic WebSocket client in Lua
3. Design plugin API for extensibility
4. Engage community for early testing feedback

## üß© IDE Integration Parity Audit & Roadmap

To ensure full parity with Anthropic's official IDE integrations, the following features are planned:

- **File Reference Shortcut:** Keyboard mapping to insert `@File#L1-99` style references into Claude prompts.
- **External `/ide` Command Support:** Ability to attach an external Claude Code CLI session to a running Neovim MCP server, similar to the `/ide` command in GUI IDEs.
- **User-Friendly Config UI:** A terminal-based UI for configuring plugin options, making setup more accessible for all users.

These are tracked in the main ROADMAP and README.
