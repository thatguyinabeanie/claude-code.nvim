## Resume Previous Conversations

### Continue Your Work Seamlessly

**When to use:** You've been working on a task with Claude Code and need to continue where you left off in a later session.

Claude Code in Neovim provides several options for resuming previous conversations:

#### Steps

1. **Resume a suspended session**
   ```vim
   :ClaudeCodeResume
   ```
   This resumes a previously suspended Claude Code session, maintaining all context.

2. **Continue with command variants**
   ```vim
   :ClaudeCode --continue
   ```
   Or use the keymap: `<leader>cc` (if configured)

3. **Continue in non-interactive mode**
   ```vim
   :ClaudeCode --continue "Continue with my task"
   ```

**How it works:**

- **Session Management**: Claude Code sessions can be suspended and resumed
- **Context Preservation**: The entire conversation context is maintained
- **Multi-Instance Support**: Each git repository can have its own Claude instance
- **Buffer State**: The terminal buffer preserves the full conversation history

**Tips:**

- Use `:ClaudeCodeSuspend` to pause a session without losing context
- Sessions are tied to git repositories when `git.multi_instance` is enabled
- The terminal buffer shows the entire conversation history when resumed
- Use safe toggle (`:ClaudeCodeSafeToggle`) to hide Claude without stopping it

**Examples:**

```vim
" Suspend current session
:ClaudeCodeSuspend

" Resume later
:ClaudeCodeResume

" Toggle with continuation variant
:ClaudeCodeToggle continue

" Use custom keymaps (if configured)
<leader>cc  " Continue conversation
<leader>cr  " Resume session
```

## Understand New Codebases

### Get a Quick Codebase Overview

**When to use:** You've just joined a new project and need to understand its structure quickly.

#### Steps

1. **Open Neovim in the project root**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   nvim
   ```

2. **Start Claude Code**
   ```vim
   :ClaudeCode
   ```
   Or use the keymap: `<leader>cc`

3. **Ask for a high-level overview**
   ```
   > give me an overview of this codebase
   ```

4. **Dive deeper into specific components**
   ```
   > explain the main architecture patterns used here
   > what are the key data models?
   > how is authentication handled?
   ```

**Tips:**

- Use `:ClaudeCodeRefreshFiles` to update Claude's view of the project
- The MCP server provides access to project structure via resources
- Start with broad questions, then narrow down to specific areas
- Ask about coding conventions and patterns used in the project

### Find Relevant Code

**When to use:** You need to locate code related to a specific feature or functionality.

#### Steps

1. **Ask Claude to find relevant files**
   ```
   > find the files that handle user authentication
   ```

2. **Get context on how components interact**
   ```
   > how do these authentication files work together?
   ```

3. **Navigate to specific locations**
   ```
   > show me the login function implementation
   ```
   Claude can provide file paths like `auth/login.lua:42` that you can navigate to.

**Tips:**

- Use file reference shortcut `<leader>cf` to quickly insert file references
- Claude has access to LSP diagnostics and can find symbols
- The `search_files` tool helps locate specific patterns
- Be specific about what you're looking for

## Fix Bugs Efficiently

### Diagnose Error Messages

**When to use:** You've encountered an error and need to find and fix its source.

#### Steps

1. **Share the error with Claude**
   ```
   > I'm seeing this error in the quickfix list
   ```
   Or select the error text and use `:ClaudeCodeToggle selection`

2. **Ask for diagnostic information**
   ```
   > check LSP diagnostics for this file
   ```

3. **Get fix recommendations**
   ```
   > suggest ways to fix this TypeScript error
   ```

4. **Apply the fix**
   ```
   > update the file to add the null check you suggested
   ```

**Tips:**

- Claude has access to LSP diagnostics through MCP resources
- Use visual selection to share specific error messages
- The `vim_edit` tool can apply fixes directly
- Let Claude know about any compilation commands

## Refactor Code

### Modernize Legacy Code

**When to use:** You need to update old code to use modern patterns and practices.

   ```

3. **Apply changes safely**
   ```
   > refactor this function to use modern patterns while maintaining the same behavior
   ```

4. **Verify the refactoring**
   ```
   > run tests for the refactored code
   ```

**Tips:**

- Use visual mode to precisely select code for refactoring
- Claude can maintain git history awareness with multi-instance mode
- Request incremental refactoring for large changes
- Use the `vim_edit` tool's different modes (insert, replace, replaceAll)

## Work with Tests

### Add Test Coverage

**When to use:** You need to add tests for uncovered code.

#### Steps

1. **Identify untested code**
   ```
   > find functions in user_service.lua that lack test coverage
   ```

2. **Generate test scaffolding**
   ```
   > create plenary test suite for the user service
   ```

3. **Add meaningful test cases**
   ```
   > add edge case tests for the notification system
   ```

4. **Run and verify tests**
   ```
   > run the test suite with plenary
   ```

**Tips:**

- Claude understands plenary.nvim test framework
- Request both unit and integration tests
- Use `:ClaudeCodeToggle file` to include entire test files
- Ask for tests that cover edge cases and error conditions

## Create Pull Requests

### Generate Comprehensive PRs

**When to use:** You need to create a well-documented pull request for your changes.

#### Steps

1. **Review your changes**
   ```
   > show me all changes in the current git repository
   ```

   > /project:config-review
   ```

**Tips:**

- Create commands for repetitive tasks
- Include checklist items in commands
- Use $ARGUMENTS for flexible commands
- Share useful commands with your team

## Run Parallel Claude Code Sessions

### Multi-Instance Development

**When to use:** You need to work on multiple features or bugs simultaneously.

#### With Git Multi-Instance Mode

1. **Enable multi-instance mode** (default)
   ```lua
   require('claude-code').setup({
     git = {
       multi_instance = true
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Work in different git repositories**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd ~/projects/frontend
   nvim
   :ClaudeCode  # Instance for frontend

   # Terminal 2
   cd ~/projects/backend
   nvim
   :ClaudeCode  # Separate instance for backend
   ```

#### With Neovim Tabs

1. **Use different tabs for different contexts**
   ```vim
   " Tab 1: Feature development
   :tabnew
   :cd ~/project/feature-branch
   :ClaudeCode

   " Tab 2: Bug fixing
   :tabnew
   :cd ~/project/bugfix
   :ClaudeCode
   ```

**Tips:**

- Each git root gets its own Claude instance
- Instances maintain separate contexts
- Use `:ClaudeCodeToggle` to switch between instances
- Buffer names include git root for identification
- Safe toggle allows hiding without stopping
