![Claude Code in Neovim](https://github.com/greggh/claude-code.nvim/blob/main/assets/claude-code.png?raw=true)

This plugin provides:

- **Context-aware commands** that automatically pass file content, selections, and workspace context to Claude Code
- **Traditional terminal interface** for interactive conversations
- **Enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that allows Claude Code to directly read and edit your Neovim buffers, execute commands, and access project context

## Features

### Terminal interface

- üöÄ Toggle Claude Code in a terminal window with a single key press
- üîí **Safe window toggle** - Hide/show window without interrupting Claude Code execution

- üîÑ Automatically detect and reload files modified by Claude Code
- ‚ö° Real-time buffer updates when files are changed externally
- üìä Process status monitoring and instance management
- üì± Customizable window position and size (including floating windows)
- ü§ñ Integration with which-key (if available)
- üìÇ Automatically uses git project root as working directory (when available)

### Context-aware integration ‚ú®

- üìù **Direct buffer editing** - Claude Code can read and modify your Neovim buffers directly
- ‚ö° **Real-time context** - Access to cursor position, buffer content, and editor state
- üõ†Ô∏è **Vim command execution** - Run any Vim command through Claude Code
- üéØ **Visual selections** - Work with selected text and visual mode
- üîç **Window management** - Control splits and window layout
- üìå **Marks & registers** - Full access to Vim's marks and registers
- üîí **Secure by design** - All operations go through Neovim's socket API

### Development

- üß© Modular and maintainable code structure
- üìã Type annotations with LuaCATS for better IDE support
- ‚úÖ Configuration validation to prevent errors
- üß™ Testing framework for reliability (44 comprehensive tests)

## Planned features for ide integration parity

To match the full feature set of GUI IDE integrations (VSCode, JetBrains, etc.), the following features are planned:

- **File Reference Shortcut:** Keyboard mapping to insert `@File#L1-99` style references into Claude prompts.
- **External `/ide` Command Support:** Ability to attach an external Claude Code command-line tool session to a running Neovim MCP server, similar to the `/ide` command in GUI IDEs.
- **User-Friendly Config UI:** A terminal-based UI for configuring plugin options, making setup more accessible for all users.

These features are tracked in the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and ensure full parity with Anthropic's official IDE integrations.

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.7.0 or later
- [Claude Code command-line tool](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed
  - The plugin automatically detects Claude Code in the following order:
    1. Custom path specified in `config.cli_path` (if provided)
    2. Local installation at `~/.claude/local/claude` (preferred)
    3. Falls back to `claude` in PATH
- [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) (dependency for git operations)
- Node.js (for MCP server) - the wrapper will install `mcp-neovim-server` automatically

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for version history and updates.

## Installation

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
return {
  "greggh/claude-code.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim", -- Required for git operations
  },
  config = function()
    require("claude-code").setup()
  end
}

```

## How it works

This plugin provides two complementary ways to interact with Claude Code:

### Terminal interface

1. Creates a terminal buffer running the Claude Code command-line tool
2. Sets up autocommands to detect file changes on disk
3. Automatically reloads files when they're modified by Claude Code
4. Provides convenient keymaps and commands for toggling the terminal
5. Automatically detects git repositories and sets working directory to the git root

### Context-aware integration

1. Analyzes your codebase to discover related files through imports/requires
2. Tracks recently accessed files within your project
3. Provides multiple context modes (file, selection, workspace)
4. Automatically passes relevant context to Claude Code command-line tool
5. Supports multiple programming languages (Lua, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go)

### Mcp server

1. Uses an enhanced fork of mcp-neovim-server with additional features
2. Provides tools for Claude Code to directly edit buffers and run commands
3. Exposes enhanced resources including related files and workspace context
4. Enables programmatic access to your development environment

### File reference shortcut ‚ú®

- Quickly insert a file reference in the form `@File#L1-99` into the Claude prompt input.
- **How to use:**
  - Press `<leader>cf` in normal mode to insert the current file and line (e.g., `@myfile.lua#L10`).
  - In visual mode, `<leader>cf` inserts the current file and selected line range (e.g., `@myfile.lua#L5-7`).
- **Where it works:**
  - Inserts into the Claude prompt input buffer (or falls back to the command line if not available).
- **Why:**
  - Useful for referencing code locations in your Claude conversations, just like in VSCode/JetBrains integrations.

**Examples:**

- Normal mode, cursor on line 10: `@myfile.lua#L10`
- Visual mode, lines 5-7 selected: `@myfile.lua#L5-7`
