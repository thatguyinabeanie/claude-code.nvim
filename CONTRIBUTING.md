For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss your proposed changes.

## Development Setup

For detailed instructions on setting up a development environment, required tools, and testing procedures, please refer to the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file. This comprehensive guide includes:

- Installation instructions for all required development tools on various platforms
- Detailed explanation of the project structure
- Testing processes and guidelines
- Troubleshooting common issues

To set up a development environment:

1. Read the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) guide to ensure you have all necessary tools installed
2. Clone your fork of the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/greggh/claude-code.nvim.git
```

3. Link the repository to your Neovim plugins directory or use your plugin manager's development mode

4. Make sure you have the Claude Code CLI tool installed and properly configured

5. Set up the Git hooks for automatic code formatting:
```bash
./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

This will set up pre-commit hooks to automatically format Lua code using StyLua before each commit.

### Development Dependencies

The [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file contains detailed information about:

- [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) - For automatic code formatting
- [LuaCheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) - For static analysis (linting)
- [LDoc](https://github.com/lunarmodules/LDoc) - For documentation generation (optional)
- Other tools and their installation instructions for different platforms

## Coding Standards

- Follow the existing code style and structure
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular
- Add appropriate documentation for new features

## Lua Style Guide

We use [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) to enforce consistent formatting of the codebase. The formatting is done automatically via pre-commit hooks if you've set them up using the script provided.

Key style guidelines:
- Configuration is in `stylua.toml` at the project root
- Maximum line length is 120 characters
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use local variables when possible
- Group related functions together
- Follow existing naming conventions:
  - `snake_case` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for classes and constructors

Files are linted using [LuaCheck](https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck) according to `.luacheckrc`.

## Testing

Before submitting your changes, please test them thoroughly:

### Running Tests

You can run the test suite using the Makefile:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test groups
make test-basic    # Run basic functionality tests
make test-config   # Run configuration tests
make test-plenary  # Run plenary tests
```

See `test/README.md` and `tests/README.md` for more details on the different test types.

### Manual Testing

- Test in different environments (Linux, macOS, Windows if possible)
- Test with different configurations
- Test the integration with the Claude Code CLI
- Use the minimal test configuration (`tests/minimal-init.lua`) to verify your changes in isolation

## Documentation

When adding new features, please update the documentation:

- Update README.md with any new features, configurations, or dependencies
- Update the Neovim help documentation in doc/claude-code.txt
- Include examples of how to use the new features
